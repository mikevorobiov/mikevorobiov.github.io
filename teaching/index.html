      Mykhailo Vorobiov did a great job helping us through the physics labs. 
      If we did not understand something he would help us reevaluate the way 
      were looking at a question and reexplain the concepts.

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      Mr.Vorobiov was an excellent instructor for this Physics Lab course. He made sure to explain the labs before starting and answered all questions we had adequately while we were working within our lab groups. He is by far one of the best lab instructors I have had.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      He is very good at answering questions during the lab, and he is willing to help students succeed. It was very helpful having him as my Lab TA.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      Great lab instructor! I really appreciated the lectures at the beginning of lab. They were so clear and helpful. Additionally, when we had a question during lab, he helped us and guided us to the correct answer. Very knowledgeable. My only suggestion is trying to line up the lab with the class better. I found it was more beneficial to do labs for materials we already covered in class.

      Excellent experience with the course. TA was enthusiastic and knowledgable about course content and structure. Expectations were clear and the assignments were consistent with expectations for the course. Excellent communication with the TA (responding to emails in timely manner; answers questions in class fully until student is satisfied). High praise for this lab section.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      The labs have honestly helped my understanding of physics more than the lectures.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      You transitioned to online learning due to the Covid-19 outbreak very well and I really appreciate that. Your labs were very straight forward and the usage of simulators was a perfect way to substitute for not being able to conduct the labs by hand in class. You were my favorite professor this semester, and I hope you have some happy holidays Professor Vorobiov.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      This course was amazingly consistent. The expectations and assignments were the same structure every week which made it feel a lot more manageable.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      My lecture section fell behind schedule and as result the labs often involved new material I hadn't seen before. Despite this, the lab assignments were still very clear and the TA offered informative lectures during the zoom sessions to help catch us up. This course adjusted to the online experience very well.

      Great TA lab instructor. He was knowledgeable and answered questions in the lab thoroughly as well as through email when the lab went to online format. I would take another lab with him as the instructor.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      I learned a lot from lab!
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      Mykhailo was always very willing to answer questions, even ones that seemed like "stupid questions". I enjoyed being in his lab section very much as he helped make the material less confusing. On the other hand, when classes transitioned to online, the labs became very confusing and hard to follow (which is not Mykhailo's fault, but rather the Physics Lab Dept's).

      My only wish was that the lab was worth a full credit as opposed to only 10% of the grade of a 5 credit class, where often students may be in lab for 2 hours. Even introductory chemistry labs are considered at least a credit when you are at the lab for less time.

      I liked that he took the time at the beginning of the class to explain to us what we need to do. I also liked that he used multiple colors to organize what he was writing out on the bored.

  <blockquote>    
      Great teacher and person. He always has a positive attitude and is ready to answer any questions. He does a great job of laying out what is going to happen during the lab session and what information you need to get through it.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      He is a great lab instructor. He knows the fundamentals of physics and applications thoroughly and able to explain to us clearly. He is also always willing to help out a student that is in need.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>    
      He was a great TA but the labs were not aligned with what we were covering in class. They were a chapter ahead and did not help at the time. If the HW, recitations, lectures, and quizzes are on chapter 4 the lab was on chapter 5. Which didnt help us learn chapter 5 since chapter 4 was what we were trying to understand at that time.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      Mykhailo was very helpful and very understanding and receptive to questions asked during class time
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>    
      Mykhailo was great - he was always helpful and ready to answer questions. My only point for improvement for this course is about the lab manual. For some reason, about halfway through the labs, the conclusion page stopped having the conclusion template on it. It's not a major problem but it ended up requiring a lot of superfluous and tedious writing to write out what the earlier templates had included.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>    
      This is defiantly a course to weed out the students who dont actually want to learn, and thus it was very intensive. The Professor was a remarkable teacher, I just struggled understanding the concepts as they began to feel less physical and more theoretical.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>    
      Despite the intimidating accent he was always very kind and helpful. Genuinely one of the only ways I'm getting by in the lecture portion of class is because he's an excellent teacher.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      I would highly recommend Vorobiov as a physics lab TA. He is extremely intelligent, helpful, and kind.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      I appreciated that Michael gave us an explanation of concepts when we had not learned about them in class yet. I think that he also answered questions well. In general, he made things easy, which I think is a positive.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      The labs were well structured and I liked the short introductions in the beginning of class.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      Lab really helped with my understanding of concepts for tests and quizzes. Vorobiov was also one of the instructors in my recitation and I preferred when he answered my questions because he explains physics in a way that makes things click.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>    
      You were great! Thanks!

  Towards the end of the semester, labs were ahead of lecture. You did a very good and straightforward job of teaching us the material required to complete the lab. In some instances, your explanations made more sense than what we learned in lecture. I am not a fan of physics or labs, but this lab was not a pain to take or participate in.

      Mykhailo was very helpful in the lab. He would answer our questions and guide us through the lab before starting. He is also nice and easy to approach for help. Although physics is my least favorite class, Mykhailo made the lab section engaging.
